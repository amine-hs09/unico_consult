# Unico Consult

This project is a basic Django setup. It includes separate directories for frontend templates, an admin portal, and static assets.

- `templates/` holds all HTML templates for the frontend.
- `admin_portal/` contains files for the admin interface.
- `static/` stores static resources like CSS and JavaScript.

The templates now support SEO metadata and social media links. Default values are defined in `admin_portal/site_settings.py` and can be used by the rendering logic.
